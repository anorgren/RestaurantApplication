# Restaurant Application

A simple API/Application that allows users to find recipes that fit within provided nutritional parameters or contain certain ingredients, as well as restaurants that provide similar cuisines as a given recipe.

### Overview  

This project was created for my Database Management Systems class and as such, the front end view is very much a work in progress. The main focus was to create a basic API that utilizes a local, user created mySQL database and exposes that information in a meaningful manner to the end-user.

### Technology Stack
- Jsp 2.3
- Bootstrap 4
- Apache Tomcat 9
- Database: local mySQL instance
- Java 8
